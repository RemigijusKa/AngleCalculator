# AngleCalculator

The program counts and prints the angle between traditional clock arrows. 

User has to input hours value, in 12 or 24 hour format.
Then user has to input minutes value. 

The program converts hour value form 24 to 12 hour format and later uses it in calulations.

Calculations:
1. Calculate the angle which hour arrow travels according to hour input data.
2. Calculate the angle which minute arrow travels according to minute input data.
3. Add angle which hour arrow travels according to minute input data. 
4. Calucate the difference beweteen both arrow angles.
5. If the asnwer is bigger than 180 degrees, calculate the difference between 360 degrees and answer, to represent the smaller angle between arrows.
